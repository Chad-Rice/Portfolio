                        <p>I have really enjoyed the data analysis and applied machine Learning modules, that I have
                            done in college, because of this I have applied to take part in the Nvidia workshop.
                            This will result in a NVIDIA certification.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            A job assocaiated with either of those modules interests me as I like see how data
                            can be visaulised into useful information. I also enjoy looking at different datasets
                            even if I don't have an interest in that particular topic.
                            Earlier this year I did an assignment about Natural Language Porcessing which is used in
                            machine learning. NLP, teaches programs to understand human language e.g. you ask
                            ChatGPT a question how does it understand your question and display an appropriate
                            answer.
                            <br>
                            NLP has been used for programs like google translate, Siri and Alexa, gps and most
                            notably in the last year it is being used by ChatGPT.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Since I did an internship in Quality Assurance testing I also wouldn't mind pursuing
                            a career in that field as I found it easy to understand and complete work for.
                            However I am more interested in pursuing a career in other computing fields first as
                            I would like to use what I have learned over the last 4 years more and I also found
                            testing to be a bit boring at times as the first few weeks of a new sprint is mostly
                            waiting for developers to finish there code

                            <li>In 3rd year I had a project for data analysis. I decided to do my project on the affects population has on housing prices in Dublin, Wexford, Cork and Galway, with particular interest in the prices around the recession. 
                                <br> 
                                <br>
                                I got a dataset that had the house prices from 1996 until 2015. In this dataset I could clearly see a drop in house prices around 2008, 2009 that lasted until 2013 to 2014 depending on the area. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I wasn't able to find a good population dataset sadly. This was due to the years the census is taken in Ireland to vary. The closest census to the start of the recession was in 2011, there was a census taken in 2016 that was useful for the house prices in 2015.</li>

                            <li>For my 2nd year project, my group decided to make a cinema ticket booking site using django. We had a lot of issues with github that caused delays in our project as people weren't able to push there code to the main branch due to significant changes. 
                                <br> The only way we were able to fix this was to completely wipe our database each time, which then meant we had to recreate all products and any users.</li>

                        <p>I enjoy playing video games, and watching movies and t.v. shows. I play video games on my
                            desktop PC
                            and another interest of mine is PC hardware. I have built my own desktop pc. <br>
                            <br>I first got my PC in 2020 and I had an AMD Ryzen 7 3700x cpu, Nvidia Geforce 2060
                            gpu, with 16gb of
                            ram.
                            In 2022 I upgraded my graphics card to a Nvidia Geforce 3070ti and my ram to 32gb of
                            ram. This meant I had to upgrade my PC case and power supply as the old case was to
                            small and the new gpu needed a minimum of 650 watts, so I got 750 watts to be safe.
                            <br>
                            <br>In October I releaized that my gpu was being bottlenecked by the AMD Ryzen 7 was too
                            weak for the new gpu and this was casuing my fps to drop in games. So I upgraded my cpu
                            to an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X. This meant I also had to upgrade my motherboard as my old
                            motherboard was AMD 4 and then new cpu is AMD 5. I also had to get new ram as the new
                            motherboard used DDR5 instead of DDR4.
